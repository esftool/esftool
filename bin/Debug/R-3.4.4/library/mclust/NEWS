Version 5.4
    o Model-based hierarchical clustering used to start the EM-algorithm
      is now based on the scaled SVD transformation proposed by Scrucca and
      Raftery (2016).
      This change is not backward compatible. However, previous results can
      be easily obtained by issuing the command:
      mclust.options(hcUse = "VARS")
      For more details see help("mclust.options").
    o Added 'subset' parameter in mclust.options() to control the maximal 
      sample size to be used in the initial model-based hierarchical phase.
    o predict.densityMclust() can optionally returns the density on a 
      logarithm scale.
    o removed normalization of mixing proportions for new models in single 
      mstep.
    o Internal rewrite of code used by packageStartupMessage().
    o Fix a small bug in MclustBootstrap() in the univariate data case.
    o Fix bugs when both the noise and subset are provided for initialization.
    o Vignette updated to include references, startup message, css style, etc.
    o Various bugs fix in plotting methods when noise is present.
    o Update references in citation() and man pages.

    o added option to use subset in the hierarchical initialization step when
      a noise component is present.

      need of data for classification plots but extract the data from the
      'clustCombi' object.
    o added combiTree() plot for 'clustCombi' objects.
    o clPairs() now produces a single scatterplot in the bivariate case.
    o fix a bug in imputeData() when seed is provided. Now if a seed is 
      provided the data matrix is reproducible. 
    o in imputeData() and imputePairs() some name of arguments have been
      modified to be coherent with the rest of the package.
    o added functions matchCluster() and majorityVote().

Version 5.2 (2016-03)
    o added argument 'x' to Mclust() to use BIC values from previous 
      computations to avoid recomputing for the same models. The same
      argument and functionality was already available in mclustBIC().
    o added argument 'x' to mclustICL() to use ICL values from previous 
      computations to avoid recomputing for the same models.
    o corrected a bug on plot.MclustBootstrap for the "mean" and "var" in
      the univariate case.
    o modified uncertainty plots.
    o introduction of as.Mclust and as.densityMclust to convert object to 
      specific mclust classes.
    o solved a numerical accuracy problem in qclass when the scale of x is 
      (very) large by making the tolerance eps scale dependent.
    o use transpose subroutine instead of non-Fortran 77 TRANSPOSE function
      in mclustaddson.f

    o added the four missing models (EVV, VEE, EVE, VVE) to the mclust
      family. A noise component is allowed, but no prior is available. 
    o added mclustBootstrapLRT function (and print and plot methods) for
      selecting the number of mixture components based on the bootstrap 
      sequential likelihood ratio test.
    o added MclustBootstrap function (and print and summary methods) for
      performing bootstrap inference. This provides standard errors for 
      parameters and confidence intervals.
    o a "A quick tour of mclust" vignette is included as html generated using
      rmarkdown and knitr. Older vignettes are included as other
      documentation for the package.
    o modified arguments to mvn2plot to control colour, lty, lwd, and pch of
      ellipses and mean point.
    o added functions emX, emXII, emXXI, emXXX, cdensX, cdensXII, cdensXXI,
      and cdensXXX, to deal with single-component cases, so calling the em
      function works even if G = 1. 
    o small changes to icl.R, now icl is a generic method, with specialized 
      methods for 'Mclust' and 'MclustDA' objects.
    o bug fixes for transformations in the initialization step when some 
      variables are constant (i.e. the variance is zero) or a one-dimensional
      data is provided.
    o change the order of arguments in hc (and all the functions calling it).
    o small modification to CITATION file upon request of CRAN maintainers.

      Gaussian mixture distribution.
    o bug fixes on summaryMclustBIC, summaryMclustBICn, Mclust to return a 
      matrix of 1s on a single column for z even in the case of G = 1. This 
      is to avoid error on some plots.
    o pdf files (previously included as vignettes) moved to inst/doc with 
      corresponding index.html.

Version 4.3 (2014-03)
    o bug fix for logLik.MclustDA() in the univariate case.

      variables or a transformation of them should be used for
      hierarchical clustering.
    o included "hcUse" in mclust.options to be passed as default to hc().
    o original data (and class for classification models) are stored in the
      object returned by the main functions.
    o add component "hypvol"" to Mclust object which provide the hypervolume
      of the noise component when required, otherwise is set to NA.
    o add a warning when prior is used and BIC returns NAs.
    o bug fixes for summary.Mclust(), print.summary.Mclust(), plot.Mclust() 
      and icl() in the case of presence of a noise component.
    o some plots on plot.MclustDR() require plot.new() before calling
      plot.window().
