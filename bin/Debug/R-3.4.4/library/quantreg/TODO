# To Do List 

1.  Return full covariance matrix for multiple quantile cases, and perhaps expand 
anova.rq to do more general testing.  (Portnoy:  January, 2012)

2.  Add option for mfrow and mfcol in plot.rqss (Ng:  January, 2012)  

3.  Add error for models with lasso when there aren't coefs to penalize, see example in
tests/tong/test2.R.

4.  Allow predict.rqs to do confidence bands see tests/fischer/test.R  August 30 2016.
